I - Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.

D -  Figure out how to make space for three stacks.


E & A (Duke's 7 Steps) :


(1)  N/A


(2)

By dividing the length of the array in 3, and only allowing each stack grow in the given space made by splitting the array on three.


(3)

storing three different sets of data in one array.

(4)

In the array size 9, when divided by 3 you will have 3 spaces for each for example: 
s1,s1,s1,

(5)

Implementation in code above 

(6)

Tried on array sizes 9,6,8,1,0


(7) There is the need of fixing arrays non divisible by 3 


L: Strategy works for all cases with added exeptions.
