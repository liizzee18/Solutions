public static boolean uniqueString(String s){

  Hashset <Character> set = new Hashset<Character>();
  
      for(int i = 0; i<s.length; i++){
        if(set.contains(S.charAt(i)){
        set.add(S.charAt(i);

       }
} 


I - Determine if a string has all unique characters.

D - Returns true if the characters in a string are unique, false otherwise.

E - When the string is recieved, a hashset is created to store the characters of the string. 
    The string is then iterated and checked if its contais any of the characters that have been seen before in the hashset.

A - Some anticipated outcomes might be that the given string only has 1 character.

L - The algorithm worked and this is a basic problem to be solved so there might be similar 
    problems that require to iterate through a string and check for a specific given character.
