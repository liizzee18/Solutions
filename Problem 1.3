I - Replace all spaces in a string with '%20: You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold 
    the additional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string.

D - Find spaces in a string and replace every single one with the %20.


E & A (Duke's 7 Steps):

(1)	Input: "Mr John Smith " J 13" 
	Start traveresing array -->  Mr space (place%20) John (place%20) Smith ... etc.
	Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"
	
(2) With the given string an additional string with "%20" is created then using the method replaceAll can substitude 
    the spaces with the new created string with "%20".

(4)   "My name is Elizabeth"
      r="%20"
      new string= "My%20name%20is%20Elizabeth"

(5) Implementation of the code is above 


(6) "Mr John Smith " J 13"
    "go"
    "My name is Elizabeth "
    " "
    "Kiwii"

(7) By using the method of replace all it avoided the use of using for loops to iterate through the string and replace 


L - With the correct exceptions the cases will work.
